Welcome to Atlas, a picture-oriented flashcard program.

Download Atlas.jar for the current runnable version
optionally download starterdeck_anatomy.tar for pre-created cards

Once the program is running, click the question mark or navigate to 
  Help -> Tutorial for an overview of its functionality

*Note*: this program creates a (or uses the existing) folder called 
  'Atlas' in the directory returned by the call to 
  System.getProperty("user.home")
